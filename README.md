# Semantic-Segmentation
## Semantic Segmentation for Self-Driving Cars using Unet
The primary objective of this project is to utilize Tensorflow in training an artificial neural network for semantic segmentation. This network will be used to identify and label road pixels in images captured by a self-driving car simulator called CARLA.

### Data set
This dataset includes images and associated labeled semantic segmentations obtained from the CARLA self-driving car simulator. It was created as a component of the Lyft Udacity Challenge. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training machine learning algorithms to recognize semantic segmentation, such as identifying cars and roads within an image.

The dataset comprises five sets, each containing 1000 images along with their corresponding labels.
