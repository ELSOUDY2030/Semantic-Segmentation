# Semantic-Segmentation
## Semantic Segmentation for Self-Driving Cars using Unet
The primary objective of this project is to utilize Tensorflow in training an artificial neural network for semantic segmentation. This network will be used to identify and label road pixels in images captured by a self-driving car simulator called CARLA.
